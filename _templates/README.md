# Spec Templates

These templates are used to keep specifications consistent across the repository.

## Rules of thumb

- **Contracts** define the supported public surface area and compatibility guarantees.
- **Design docs** explain internals and rationale and must not restate contract details.
- **RFCs** propose significant changes; **ADRs** record final decisions.

## Status values

- `draft`
- `proposed`
- `accepted`
- `implemented`
- `superseded`
